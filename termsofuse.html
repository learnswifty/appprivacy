      <p>For a better experience, while using our Service, we may request permission to access certain data on your device (for example, media files and contacts) solely for app functionality. We do not collect any end-user personal information on our servers.</p>
      <p>The information that the app accesses or processes is retained on your device and is not collected, transmitted, or stored by the Developer in any way.</p>
