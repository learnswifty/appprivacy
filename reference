                            device, which uniquely identify your mobile device
                            (but not your personality). Device identifier
                            enables generalized reporting or personalized

                            scripts). A cookie is a text file containing small
                            amounts of information which is downloaded to your
                            device when you access the App. The text file is
                            then sent back to the server each time you use the
                            App. This enables us to operate the App more
                            effectively. For example, we will know how many
                            users access specific areas or features within our
                            App and which links or ads they clicked on. We use
                            this aggregated information to understand and
                            optimize how our App is used, improve our marketing
                            efforts, and provide content and features that are
                            of interest to you. We may ask advertisers or other
                            partners to serve ads or services to the App, which
                            may use cookies or similar technologies.

                    <p>
                        You can manage your activity tracking permissions. Inter
                        alia, if you don’t want third-party service providers to

                                versions of iOS) > Tracking, then tap to turn
                                off or turn on permission to track for a
                                specific app.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                You can also control whether apps can ask for
                                permission to track your activity. If you don’t
                                want to be asked for your permission, or do not

                                from apps that want to track your activity. Each
                                app that asks for permission to track while this
                                setting is turned off will be treated as if you

                    <h1>IX. SECURITY</h1>
                    <p>
                        The security of your personal information is highly
                        important to us. We follow generally accepted industry
                        standards to protect the personal information submitted
                        to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We take reasonable and appropriate measures to protect
                        personal information from loss, misuse and unauthorized
                        access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, taking
                        into account the risks involved in the processing and
                        the nature of the personal information.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We implement appropriate technical and organizational
                        measures, which are designed to implement
                        data-protection principles, such as data minimization,
                        in an effective manner and to integrate the necessary
                        safeguards into the processing. We seek your personal
                        data to be encrypted with proper and strong encryption
                        algorithms, including hashing where possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unfortunately, no method of transmission over the
                        Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100%
                        secure. We do our best to protect your personal data,
                        nevertheless, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
                        In the event that your personal information is
                        compromised as a breach of security, we will promptly
                        notify you in compliance with applicable law.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you have any questions about the security of our App,

                    <h1>X. CHILDREN’S PRIVACY</h1>
                    <p>
                        Our App is not intended for children. Therefore, we do
                        not knowingly or intentionally collect or solicit any
                        personal information from children. For the purposes of
                        this Section X the terms “child” and/or “children” in
                        the context of data processing activities may be
                        interpreted on a case-by-case basis as prescribed by
                        applicable data protection laws. No one who is
                        considered a “child” under applicable data protection
                        laws is allowed to directly provide any personal
                        information to the App.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As a general rule we consider a person under the age of
                        16 to be regarded as “a child” until we have legal
                        grounds to conclude that a person under 16 should be
                        treated as an adult as per provisions of local data
                        protection rules or based on the parent authorization
                        provided to us directly.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Solely the holders of parental responsibility are liable
                        for preventing their children from providing personal
                        information via the App without relevant verifiable
                        parental consent. If we learn that we have collected
                        personal information from a child without verification
                        of parental consent, we will erase that information as
                        quickly as possible. If you reasonably believe that we
                        might have any information from or about a child, or a
                        child has directly provided us with personal information
                        via the App without verifiable parental consent, please
                        contact us.
